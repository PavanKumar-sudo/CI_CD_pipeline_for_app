# Full-Stack Web Application with CI/CD, Monitoring, and GitOps on AWS EKS

This project showcases a complete full-stack web application deployment pipeline, integrating modern DevOps practices and cloud-native tools. The frontend consists of static HTML views (Login, Signup, Dashboard), while the backend is built using Node.js and Express. MySQL serves as the relational database layer, and the entire application is containerized using Docker. The backend exposes APIs for authentication and routing, while frontend forms interact with the backend over clearly defined REST endpoints. All source code is organized into cleanly separated modules with automated unit testing using Jest and Supertest.

To ensure scalability and observability, a Helm chart was designed to deploy the application onto Kubernetes. This chart provisions Deployments, Services, Secrets, Ingress, and complete monitoring infrastructure using the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm subchart. The system exposes custom Prometheus metrics from the Node.js backend, such as `http_requests_total`, and integrates Grafana dashboards to monitor CPU usage, memory, slow queries, and high request traffic. Alertmanager is configured with Gmail SMTP to send out critical alerts based on Prometheus rules for both the backend and MySQL, ensuring system reliability and prompt issue response.

A robust CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions to automate testing, container image building, vulnerability scanning with Trivy, and deployment via Helm. The pipeline dynamically tags Docker images, updates Helm chart values, and triggers deployments using ArgoCD for GitOps-based synchronization. ArgoCD monitors the Git repository for configuration changes and automatically reconciles application state on an AWS EKS cluster. With layered automation, monitoring, and GitOps, this project exemplifies an end-to-end, production-grade deployment strategy using open-source DevOps tooling.
